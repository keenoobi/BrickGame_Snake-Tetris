# BrickGame v1.0 aka Tetris

BrickGame v1.0 is a Tetris game designed for terminal, created in the C programming language with the ncurses library. It offers the traditional Tetris gameplay along with features like scoring, advancing levels, and keeping track of high scores.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay with the following mechanics:
    - Tetrominoes Rotation (even near the walls of the well)
    - Horizontal movement of tetrominoes
    - Accelerated tetromino falling (by holding the down arrow key)
    - Display of the next tetromino
    - Line clearing (up to 4)
    - Game over when the tetromino reaches the top of the well
- Support for all physical buttons on the console:
    - Start game - Enter
    - Pause - P
    - End game - Esc
    - Left arrow - move tetromino left
    - Right arrow - move tetromino right
    - Down arrow - accelerate tetromino falling
    - Up arrow - rotate tetromino (R-key also available to rotate the figure)
- Matrix-based game field with dimensions corresponding to the console's size (10x20 pixels)
- Proper stopping of tetrominoes after reaching the bottom or colliding with another tetromino
- Unit tests for the game logic library, achieving at least 80% code coverage


### Score Calculation

- 1 line cleared: 100 points
- 2 lines cleared: 300 points
- 3 lines cleared: 700 points
- 4 lines cleared: 1500 points

### High Score Tracking

- Display of the player's current score and highest score achieved
- Highest score is stored in a file and persists between game sessions

### Level Progression

- Progression of levels every 600 points
- Increasing level increases the speed of tetromino falling

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
3. Run `make install` to install the project.
4. Run `make rungame` to start playing.

Or just use `make all` to install and run the game.

## Usage

- Use the arrow keys to move and rotate tetrominoes.
- Press the down arrow key to make tetrominoes fall faster.
- Press the up arrow key to rotate tetrominoes.

# BrickGame v2.0 aka Snake

BrickGame v2.0 is a Snake game designed for desktop, created in the C++ programming language using a GUI library. It offers classic Snake gameplay along with features like scoring, level progression, and high score tracking.

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay with the following mechanics:
    - Snake moves autonomously one block forward after each game timer tick.
    - Snake's length increases by one when it collides with an "apple".
    - Game ends with a win if the snake's length reaches 200 units.
    - Game ends with a loss if the snake collides with the boundary or itself.
    - User can change the snake's direction using arrow keys, with turns limited to left and right.
    - User can accelerate the snake's movement by holding the action key.
- Initial snake length is four "pixels".
- Game field size is 10 "pixels" wide and 20 "pixels" high.
- Support for all physical buttons on the console:
    - Start game - Enter
    - Pause - P
    - End game - Esc
    - Left arrow - move snake left
    - Right arrow - move snake right
    - Up arrow - move snake up
    - Down arrow - move snake down
- Finite State Machine (FSM) to formalize game logic.
- Unit tests for the game logic library, achieving at least 80% code coverage using GTest.

### Score Calculation

- 1 point for each "apple" eaten.

### High Score Tracking

- Display of the player's current score and highest score achieved.
- Highest score is stored in a file or embedded database and persists between game sessions.

### Level Progression

- Level increases by 1 every 5 points.
- Increasing level increases the speed of the snake.
- Maximum level is 10.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
3. Run `make install` to install the project.
4. Run `make rungame` to start playing.

Or just use `make all` to install and run the game.

## Usage

- Use the arrow keys to change the snake's direction.
- Hold the action key to accelerate the snake's movement.

## Finite State Machine (FSM) Diagram

A diagram detailing all states and transitions for the implemented FSM will be provided in the project documentation.

## Additional Features

- Score and high score tracking.
- Level progression with increased speed.

## Development Guidelines

- Developed in C++17.
- Code follows Google Style.
- Classes are implemented within the `s21` namespace.
- Code is organized using the MVC pattern.
- Business logic is separated from the interface code.
- Thin controllers.
- GUI library options: Qt, GTK+.
- Makefile with standard GNU targets: all, install, uninstall, clean, dvi, dist, tests.
- Installation to an arbitrary directory.

## Testing

- Unit tests for the game logic library using GTest.
- Coverage of at least 80%.

## Project Structure

- `src/brick_game/snake` - Game logic library.
- `src/gui/desktop` - Desktop interface code.

## Documentation

- FSM diagram detailing all states and transitions.
